### Dashboard Link : https://github.com/Mackell-Watson/Workforce-Project-Management/blob/main/Employee%20Project%20Status.pbix

## Problem Statement
The primary goal of this Power BI Dashboard is to provide a centralized and detailed view of the employee involvement and progress across various projects within the organization. This dashboard includes key employee information, such as Employee ID, First & Last Names, Job Title, Department Name, and Salary, to facilitate an easy identification of each individual’s role and contribution to ongoing initiatives. Additionally, the dashboard highlights two critical KPIs that measure the Project Distributions of Buy-In, providing insights into how employees are allocated across multiple projects and their level of engagement.

The dashboard also tracks the status of these projects, categorizing them as either "Completed" or "Upcoming," to enable leadership to assess project timelines, resource allocation, and progress. This visual tool aims to streamline project oversight, helping managers monitor the completion of deliverables, understand resource gaps, and allocate future assignments more efficiently. By offering this detailed and easily accessible view, the report supports more informed decision-making, optimized workforce management, and effective project prioritization across departments.



## Key Objectives:

1. Improved Project Visibility
Provide a clear, comprehensive view of project status, showing which projects are completed or upcoming. This allows stakeholders to quickly assess the health and progress of projects across the organization.

2. Resource Allocation Optimization
Track employee involvement and distribution across various projects. This helps ensure that resources are allocated efficiently, avoiding overloading or underutilizing team members.

3. Enhanced Decision-Making
By having all relevant employee and project data in one place, the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making. Leaders can use the insights to make informed decisions about future project allocations, deadlines, and team changes.

4. Increased Employee Engagement Transparency
Provide clarity on how employees are contributing to various projects and their level of engagement. This transparency helps ensure alignment between individual contributions and organizational goals.

5. Better Performance Monitoring
The KPIs showcasing project buy-ins and status give a real-time snapshot of project health and employee performance, enabling quicker intervention and adjustments as necessary.

6. Simplified Reporting
The dashboard consolidates complex data points into an easy-to-understand visual format, reducing the time spent on manual reporting and analysis. This simplifies communication with stakeholders and leadership.

7. Cross-Department Collaboration
By showcasing employee and department-level data, the dashboard fosters a clearer understanding of interdepartmental dependencies, encouraging collaboration and alignment on project goals.

8. Project Prioritization
By showing the status of projects and employee engagement levels, this dashboard aids in determining which projects need immediate attention or additional resources, helping prioritize efforts effectively.

9. Showcase Analytical and Visualization Skills
The project demonstrates your ability to create meaningful data visualizations, highlighting your technical and analytical expertise in using Power BI to address business needs.

Marketing

Engineering

Human Resources

IT

The budget distribution by department is broken down as follows:

Project Budget Per Capital Thousands: The dashboard details the budget allocated in thousands of dollars for each department.
Project Budget by Department in Millions: The budget breakdown is also visualized in millions to offer a higher-level perspective on capital allocation across departments.
This visualization gives stakeholders a high-level overview of the financial distribution, showing the relative size of each department’s involvement in the overall project, and helps assess how the allocated budget aligns with expected project outcomes.

### Steps followed 

1.Load Data: Imported the dataset (CSV file) into Power BI Desktop.

2.Power Query Data Profiling: Opened Power Query Editor and enabled "Column Distribution," "Column Quality," and "Column Profile" options under the View tab. Adjusted column profiling to analyze the entire dataset.

3.Theme Selection: Applied a predefined theme in the report view under the View tab for better visualization.

4.Custom Visuals for Ratings: Added a new visual using the three ellipses in the Visualizations pane to represent rating data effectively.

5.Slicers for Filtering Data: Integrated slicers for various fields to enable dynamic filtering and improve interactivity.

6.KPI Cards: Added KPI card visuals to display key performance indicators such as total churn, churn rate, and new joiners.

## Summary
This Power BI Dashboard provides an integrated view of employee involvement across various projects, showcasing key information such as Employee ID, Name, Job Title, Department, and Salary. The dashboard highlights two key performance indicators (KPIs) to visualize the distribution of employee buy-in across projects, providing insights into how resources are allocated. Additionally, it tracks the status of each project, categorizing them as either "Completed" or "Upcoming."

Objective: The goal of this visualization is to improve project visibility, optimize resource allocation, and facilitate data-driven decision-making. It empowers managers to monitor project progress in real-time, allocate resources more effectively, and assess employee engagement levels in various initiatives. The dashboard helps prioritize projects based on their status and employee distribution, ultimately improving operational efficiency and performance monitoring.

By consolidating essential data in one visual tool, this Power BI Dashboard streamlines reporting processes, enhances transparency, and supports better workforce management, contributing to strategic decision-making and successful project execution.
